# Nested Comment Section

A nested comment system is a feature that allows users to share their opinions on a comment made by the author of the post or by another user. This creates a multi-level structure of the conversation, where each comment can have child comments (or replies) that form an organized thread. It visually represents the conversation in levels or layers, enabling users to follow discussions more easily, as every reply is linked to the original comment, keeping related responses together.

## Typically a nested comment system includes:

- **Parent Comment**: The original comment which is on the top layer and can have multiple responses to it.
- **Child Comments (Replies)**: Comments in response to a parent or another reply, displayed in an indented manner.
- **Upvote/Downvote**: Each comment can be either liked or disliked.
- **Timestamp**: The timestamp of the comment can be shown.
- **Threaded Display**: Every reply is shown indented to indicate the relationship within the thread.
