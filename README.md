# Building a Nested Comments System

A nested comment system is a feature, which allows users to share their opinions on a comment made by the author of the post or by another user. In this way, a multi-level structure of the conversation is created. Each of the comments can have child comments (or replies) that are forming a thread of organization. It visually represents the conversation in levels or layers. Thus, the users are able to follow the discussions far more easily, as every reply is linked to the original comment, keeping related responses together.
Typically a nested comment system includes:
Parent Comment: The original comment which is on the top layer of the macroparticle, and it can have multiple responses to it as well.
Child Comments (Replies): Comments in response to a parent or another reply, displayed in an indented manner.
Upvote/Downvote: Each comment can be either liked or disliked.
Timestamp: The timestamp of the comment can be shown.
Threaded Display: Every reply is shown indented to indicate the relation within the thread.
